# Tribes Movement Clone
A game which tries to recreate the magic of the movement mechanics from Tribes \(particularly [Tribes: Vengeance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tribes:_Vengeance)).

This project was made entirely from scratch using TypeScript and WebGL2.

You can see it in action [here](https://jorkov-jac.github.io/projects/tribes-clone)!

## Context
Tribes: Vengeance was one of the most formative games of my childhood; sometimes the first thing I would do in the morning was jetpack and ski on its varied levels for hours. This project tries to recreate the movement mechanics from that game.

## How it works
### Rendering
The level is a grid of triangles. The height at each point in the grid is sampled from a height map which looks like so:
![picture of a height map](/res/heightmap.png)

The ground's normal map is also calculated from this map.
### Physics
Physics are hard, especially when the deadline for your UI project is coming near. So instead of worrying about collision code, the player is treated as a single pointâ€”they have no dimensions. Collisions are checked with the ground directly beneath the player's feet.

The ground is made up of triangles, but using that for the ground's normal vectors would make skiing very bumpy. Instead, the ground's normal map is interpolated bilinearly, and that is used for clipping the player's velocity. This has a few side effects but provides relatively clean results.

# Building
Run `npm i` followed by `npx tsc`.
